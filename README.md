# Mate Check

An App that helps / provides a way for cautious daters and 
chess enthusiasts, who want to ask thought provoking questions by 
playing chess to assist in forming meaningful connections.

## Story
As a student at the Apple Developer Academy, Detroit; our first challenge was to create SwiftUI app that delighted our user and proved our knowledge of the basics in SwiftUI. Our team "TasteMakers" went above and beyond and delivered a fully functioning app that made it into TestFlight.

Our user was a straight shooter who's friendly and positive aura attracts all types of people. She’s great at Chess and has even traveled to almost all 50 states because of it. She agreed for us to solve her problem of her dating life in a sense, with questions to ask on dates. She’s tired of the same questions when dating and would like to get “straight to the point”

"Mate Check" is just that, a fun applictaion that can be used during a friendly game of chess that gets right down to the "need to know" about your opponent or person of interest.
